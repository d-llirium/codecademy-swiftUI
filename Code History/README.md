### by d_llirium

In this last tutorial, you took your application from a partially functioning quiz to a fully-featured application. 
You created a final view and view model to display the score. 
You then used the data from the Game model to generate a user score. 
Youâ€™ve now acquired the skills and core fundamental concepts to build an application all on your own.
