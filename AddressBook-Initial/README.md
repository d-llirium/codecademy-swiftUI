### by d_llirium

At this point, you are going beyond simply writing code to make an app do something and reasoning about how the app should go about doing something. To this end, property wrappers allow you to:

  - Reuse code by applying property wrappers to multiple properties
  - Improve the readability of your code
  - Run some code when getting or setting a property
  - Effectively manage the data in your app, sharing it between views
